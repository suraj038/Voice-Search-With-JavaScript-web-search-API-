# Working Video Demo
Since the video is gif, audio is not audible !!
But everything here works perfectly with Voice 

# Tips:
1. To stop recording, speak : stop recording 
2. To change the input you have spoken earlier: just speak another word
3. To remove input, speak : reset everything
4. Once you are finalized with which sentence u have to search thn, speak : open
